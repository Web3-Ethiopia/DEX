Explanation

    StructsForLPs.sol:
        Defines the necessary structs such as Range, LiquidityPosition, and PoolState.

    LiquidityPool.sol:
        Manages the core functionality of a liquidity pool.
        addLiquidity: Adds liquidity to the pool within a specified range.
        removeLiquidity: Removes liquidity from the pool.
        swap: Handles token swaps, ensuring the pool's state is maintained.
        getAmountOut: Calculates the output amount based on the input amount and current reserves.
        getReserves and getPrice: Fetch the current state and price of the pool.

This structure should cover the core functionalities outlined in the requirements, such as liquidity management, price calculation, and swapping within a single range pool. Additional features like advanced fee tiers and oracle integrations can be added as needed.
